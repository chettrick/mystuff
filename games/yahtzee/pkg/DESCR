Yahtzee is a simple dice-rolling game.

This implementation comes with text, curses, and graphics modes.

* Graphics mode needs an X display (DISPLAY environment variable set).
* Curses mode needs a terminal (TERM environment variable set).
* Text mode needs the other two modes to fail (no DISPLAY or TERM set).

To unset an environment variable:
	$ unset TERM
